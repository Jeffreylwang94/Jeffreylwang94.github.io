                A guy living in the Bay Area with interests in food, community, walks in the wood,
                 and technology. 
                 With a background in a couple of data-heavy, 
                 software-dev adjacent positions, he's always looking for the next problem to solve.
                 He enjoys exploring diverse interests and staying curious about the world.
